# Daily DSA Challenge
Welcome to my Daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Challenge repo! ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to my personal challenge of solving at least one DSA problem every day for a year. Each day, I'll tackle a new problem, aiming to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Structure
### Days Completed:
â€¢ [Day 1: Two Sum](./day1/) - *23/12/2023*  
â€¢ [Day 2: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](./day2/) - *24/12/2023*  
â€¢ [Day 3: Remove Element](./day3/) - *25/12/2023*  
â€¢ [Day 4: Is Palindrome Number](./day4/) - *26/12/2023*  
â€¢ [Day 5: Convert Roman Numerals to Integer](./day5/) - *27/12/2023*  
â€¢ [Day 6: Valid Parenthesis](./day6/) - *28/12/2023*  
â€¢ [Day 7: Longest Common Prefix](./day7/) - *29/12/2023*  
â€¢ [Day 8: Index of First Occurence](./day8/) - *30/12/2023*  


### Additional Resources:
â€¢ Common Data Structures

â€¢ Common Algorithms

## Daily Structure
Each day's folder contains:

â€¢ Code File(s): Solution code in Python.

â€¢ README.md: Description of the problem, approach, time taken, and reflections.

## About
I'm embarking on this journey to challenge myself, improve my problem-solving abilities, and solidify my understanding of DSA concepts. I aim to commit myself to this routine for a year, growing and learning with each problem solved.
